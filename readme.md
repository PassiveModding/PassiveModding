## In my free time
In my free time, I love to explore my passion for technology and problem-solving. This often involves working on game modifications and plugins, writing Discord bots, and tackling any technical challenges that come my way, particularly if they offer an opportunity to learn something new.


Github is a great platform for developers to showcase their work and connect with other developers. Feel free to check out my repositories or send me a message if you want to chat or collaborate on something.
