### Hi there, I'm Jaquesy :wave:
I'm an Australian DevOps Engineer with a background in software development, who is self-taught in .NET, Docker and many other technologies. 

I've worked with many technologies including:

- Docker
- ASP.NET and C#
- AWS
- Entity Framework and .NET Core
- SQL Server and PostgreSQL
- RavenDB
- Discord Bots - Discord.NET, Disqord and Discord.py
- .NET Blazor and Maui
- Typescript and JavaScript
- Node.JS and React.JS

In my free time, I enjoy working on game modifications and plugins and, I love solving any problems I come across on my journey especially if it means I get to learn something new. 

I think that github is a great platform for developers to showcase their work and connect with other developers. Feel free to check out my repositories or send me a message if you want to chat or collaborate on something
